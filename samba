To quickly set up an SMB share on a Linux system that works with Windows clients, follow these steps:

1. Install Samba:
   ```
   emerge --ask net-fs/samba
   ```

2. Configure Samba:
   Edit the Samba configuration file `/etc/samba/smb.conf` and add a share definition at the end of the file. Here's an example of a simple share:

   ```
   [sharename]
   path = /path/to/shared/directory
   browseable = yes
   writable = yes
   guest ok = yes
   ```

   Replace `sharename` with the name you want to give your share and `/path/to/shared/directory` with the actual path to the directory you want to share.

3. Set the appropriate permissions on the shared directory:
   ```
   chmod -R 0755 /path/to/shared/directory
   chown -R nobody:nogroup /path/to/shared/directory
   ```

4. Start the Samba service:
   ```
   /etc/init.d/samba start
   ```

5. Make sure the Samba service starts on boot:
   ```
   rc-update add samba default
   ```

6. If you have a firewall, allow Samba traffic through it. The ports that need to be open are 139 and 445 for TCP, and 137 and 138 for UDP.

7. On the Windows client, access the share by opening File Explorer and entering `\\<linux-server-ip>\sharename` in the address bar.

Replace `<linux-server-ip>` with the IP address of your Linux server and `sharename` with the name of your share.
